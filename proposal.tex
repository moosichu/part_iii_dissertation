\begin{abstract}

\textsl{Programming for the GPU can be complex, error-prone and hard to manage
using existing tool chains. Despite various research into creating and designing
unified programming languages which can be compiled to heterogeneous
architectures, these languages have yet to experience serious uptake in
industry due to various factors, including runtime overhead, lack of low-level
control, and other inefficiencies. The result of this is that existing
tool chains haven't experienced many of the improvements }
