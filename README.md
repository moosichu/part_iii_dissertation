# Part III Disseration

This is the repository that I used to develop my [Master's dissertation](https://github.com/moosichu/part_iii_dissertation/releases/tag/v1.1) for the University of Cambridge's Computer Science Tripos.

I'm leaving this repository public, in case anyone is interested in how that happens. My Git commit history shows how the dissertation developed over time, warts-and-all.

The source code to the project the dissertation describes can be found here: [https://github.com/moosichu/part_iii_project](https://github.com/moosichu/part_iii_project)
