{\Huge \bf Acknowledgements}
\vspace{24pt}

I would like to thank everyone who supported me through a difficult year, and
ensured that I saw this project through to the end.

I would like to thank Nicholas Timmons for providing early feedback on project
ideas, and helping me navigate the messy world of graphics programming.

I would like to especially thank my supervisor Professor Alan Mycroft, who has
been both understanding and accommodating, in addition to providing the honest
and wise feedback necessary for me to focus my thoughts.
