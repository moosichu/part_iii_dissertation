% 2. Paper explores cross module checking between languages.

Programming for Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) can be frustrating and
error-prone due to the noncompatible nature of programming languages designed
for different architectures. GPU programmers have to to contend with manually
ensuring data structures and types are preserved on the boundaries between code
for the CPU and GPU - even when using high-level programming languages on each.
Although the future holds promise with unified languages which automatically
optimise for heterogeneous architectures, they are currently either domain
specific or lack the control necessary to achieve the desired performance
levels that can be achieved using traditional workflows.

This paper explores cross module type checking between languages for
heterogeneous computing systems. Although the ideas are generalisable, the
focus is on GPUs and CPUs. Two approaches are discussed, implemented and
evaluated. The first being a front-end preprocessor for C and GLSL using
traditional backends, the second being a completely operational pair of toy
languages with compatible type systems. Both of these approaches have their own
tradeoffs, with the goal of improving the user experience when interacting with
GPUs whilst still offering the high level of control traditional workflows
provide.
